segment the object
6DOF arm 0 Rgbd camera - tooltip 

fundametal point cloud processing 
- RGBD - 3D view of the scene
- identify major plane
- using major plane segment the object

emphaszing on collecting more data for grasping
- not many literature do this, they just assume

 there are different methods to do this
 to simplify
 - segment , move and 
 - libraries for normal vectors on the project
	 - using this can we design a grasp
 - find pair of points to check grasp
 - parallel jaw gripper
	 - use force balance formulation
- view sphere
