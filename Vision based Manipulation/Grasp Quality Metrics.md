###### Minimum Singular Value of G (grasp matrix)

```ad-question
title:Questions
1. are singular values eigen values? 
2. if it is singular then shouldnt $det(M) = 0$?
3. which stability metric is useful? are there scenario in which one metric is preferred over another?
```

$Q_{MSV} = \sigma_{min}(G)$
- Eigen Values and Eigen Vector
- maximize minimum eigen value 

###### Ellipsoid Volume
multiple of all the singular values 

##### Shape of Grasp Polygon


##### Area of polygon



##### Largest minimum resisted wrench

optimize weakest force in all directions


#### Metrics based on Hand configuration

- distance to hand singularities of hand jacobian
	- far away from minimum $\sigma_{min}$
	-
